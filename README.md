## **Basic Concepts**

#### **Features x Circles**

</td>
<td valign="top">
<h5 style="font-weight: bold">Features:</h5>
In v3+, we plan to launch <em><strong>Castcle Features</strong></em> in Castcle application, including <em><a href="https://castcle-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/features_photo.png" target="_blank">Castcle Photo</a></em> and <em><a href="https://castcle-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/features_watch.png" target="_blank">Castcle Watch</a></em>, which will provide the richer user experiences than a simple <em>content feed</em> reading in v1. <i>See examples below</i>.
<h5 style="font-weight: bold">Circles:<a name="circles"></a></h5>
In v2+, the additional <em><strong>Castcle Circles</strong></em>, not only <em><strong>For You</strong></em> circle, will be available. Each <em>Castcle Circle</em> is designed to represent different social bubble. For exmaple, when user navigates to <em><strong>Friends</strong> circle</em>, he/she will only see contents posted by his/her family and friends. Then, when he/she changes to <em><strong>Following</strong> circle</em>, he/she will see a flood of contents that he/she subscribes to. There are many more circles that we plan to provide such as <em><strong>Now</strong></em>, a circle which prioritize new contents to come first, <em><strong>Topics</strong></em>, a circle that feed contents on the topics that user interests, etc.

#### **The Circle Experience:** *Let's Burst our Social Bubbles*

</a>
</td>
<td valign="top">
Since <em><strong>Castcle Circle</strong></em> is designed to represent user's social bubble <em>(see the explanation <a href="#circles">here</a>)</em>, we intentionally design the application UX letting individual user <em>change circle</em>, <em><strong>navigate through social bubbles</strong></em>, by swiping left or right on the screen. This will allow user to jump from one social bubble to other social bubbles easily, resulting in <strong>reducing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)">Echo Chamber</a> effect</strong>, as shown in the image on the left hand side.

#### **Castcle Features:** *Endless User Experiences*

As we understand that there is around 2.5 quintillion bytes of data generated worldwide nowadays, **there would be an endless posibilities that a new media type or a new representation of user created contents will emerge each day**. For example, the rise of *TikTok*, a big tech giant from China, who introduces a new way of micro-blogging using short vdo clip to the world.

Consequently, **to make Castcle Platform sustainable**, we have designed the platform **to apply its Rewarding System to any kinds of content by using CAST Token.** This is how ***Castcle Features*** will play its role.

##### Features Switcher

</a>
</td>
<td valign="top">
In v3+, the <em><strong>Castcle Features</strong></em> such as <em><strong>Photo</strong></em> and <em><strong>Watch</strong></em> will be launched. If there are additional <em>features</em> released in the future, the <strong><em>Create Post</em> button</strong> will be replaced by <em><strong>Features Switcher</strong></em> at the center of app bottom bar. As you can see in the image on the left hand side, <strong>there are uncountable feature integrations that Castcle --and CAST Token-- can apply to.</strong> For example, <em>Castcle Commerce</em>, <em>Castcle Music</em>, <em>Castcle NFT</em>, <em>Castcle Comics</em>, etc.
